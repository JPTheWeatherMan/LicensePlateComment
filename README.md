## About

PlateComment is an innovative mobile application designed to create a community-driven platform where users can share feedback or comments about other drivers based on their license plates. It aims to foster a more accountable and communicative driving culture. 

With PlateComment, users can:
- **Post Comments**: Leave constructive feedback about driving behaviors associated with specific license plates. 
- **View Feedback**: Check comments made about your own vehicle's license plate and gain insights into how others perceive your driving.
- **Community Moderation**: Report inappropriate or abusive comments, ensuring a respectful and helpful environment.
- **Anonymity & Privacy**: Share and view comments without revealing personal information, maintaining privacy for all users.

This app is not a tool for reporting driving incidents to authorities but serves as a means for drivers to give and receive casual feedback. It's an attempt to enhance roadway communication and encourage a more mindful driving culture.
